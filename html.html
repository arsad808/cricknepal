        <p><strong>July 11, 2024:</strong> The Nepalese national women’s cricket team suffered a 33-run defeat in their first practice match in Sri Lanka. Nepal is playing three T20 matches against the Sri Lanka Development Squad as part of their preparation for the ACC Women’s Asia Cup 2024, which begins on July 19 in Sri Lanka. The Nepalese side invited the home side to bat first, who scored 118/8 in the allotted 20 overs. Imesha Dulani and Kaushini Nuthyangana, who have played a few WT20I matches, jointly top-scored with 27 runs. For Nepal, pacer Sabnam Rai grabbed three wickets, whilst Rajmati Airee got one wicket. Due to rain in the second inning, the revised target was 96 runs from 15 overs. Nepal managed to score only 63/9 at the end of 15 overs. Rubina Chhetri led the batting card with a run-a-ball 17, whereas Sita Rana Magar scored a sluggish 28-ball 11. For Sri Lanka, Dewmi Vihanga picked up three wickets while Shehani bagged a couple of wickets. The second match will be played tomorrow (July 10). The Nepalese team will travel to Malaysia on July 13 to participate in the ACC Women’s Asia Cup.</p>
